Welcome to rrg_climbing_game's documentation!
=============================================

This project is an ongoing project to create a game that simulates climbing.

Objective of the game
----------------------

To play the game you select a CLIMBER.

Each CLIMBER utilize different skills and tactics to ascend a ROUTE.

The CLIMBER'S objective is to SEND as many ROUTES as they can in one session of climbing.

The ROUTES are contained in a group called a CRAG.
CRAGS are sorted into AREAS within the RED RIVER GORGE.

Each ROUTE has its own characteristics and qualities that result in its overall difficulty.
The CLIMBERS skills and tactics are compared to the routes difficulty to determine if the climber will SEND the route.
