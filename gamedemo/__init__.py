Red River Gorge : Rock Climbing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This was adapted from a pluralsight tutorial < 'https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/python-best-practices-code-quality/table-of-contents' >

The idea is to simulate a very simple role-playing game where a climber is working on climbing a route. 

The game mechanics are controlled by the :class:`game.Game` class.

The climbers are controlled by the :class:`~gamedemo.climbers.Climber` instances.

Each of which has a :class:`~gamedemo.skills.Skill` to use to send a rock climb.

The scenario will be rock climbing. where a climber and belayer are trying to SEND a rock climb together.
